## Apis:
#### Carpark Availability: https://data.gov.sg/dataset/carpark-availability
The API can best receive 4 days of data in a row
the next day there will be too much timeout
Better set sleep time of 8 mins in between calls for better runtime

eg: 	1st day -- 5 mins
	2st day -- 5 mins
	3rd day -- 7 mins
	4th day -- 8 mins
	5th day -- 15 mins
